blank system alert ater hitting first kull to ves--i think it's because i might've triggered the next frag, but th frag wasnt able to show since i wasnt in the limit yet so make sure it only triggers when you'e in the right range after frag == 8 or w/e (or it's another warning)

for testing purposes:
  * snakegame should be 60
  * self-desig frag time should be at east 90s-120s
